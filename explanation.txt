Explanation:

The move_files function is defined to transfer files from a source S3 bucket in one AWS account to a destination S3 bucket in another AWS account.

Account aliases (accA and accB) are assigned to represent the source and destination accounts for better readability.

Sessions are created for Account A and Account B using the AWS CLI profile names specified (Pratish-source and Pratish-destination, respectively).

S3 clients are created for Account A and Account B using the sessions.

The list_objects_v2 method is called on the Account A S3 client to retrieve a list of objects in the source bucket. The response is stored in the response variable.

The code checks if the 'Contents' key exists in the response. If not, it means the source bucket is empty, and a message is printed indicating that there are no files to move. The function returns at this point to prevent further execution.

If the source bucket is not empty, the objects are extracted from the response variable.

The code iterates over each object in the source bucket and retrieves the object key (path).

The copy_object method is called on the Account B S3 client to copy the object from the source bucket in Account A to the destination bucket in Account B. The object is copied using the same object key.

A success message is printed for each file that is moved, indicating the source and destination accounts and the file's key.

The function is called with the source and destination bucket names to initiate the file transfer.
